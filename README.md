# graphics-demos
Every graphics demo I wrote for my talk

Check out https://github.com/porglezomp/pixel-canvas for the library, and [download the talk slides from Google drive][talk].

These demos depend on nightly. If you want to build them on stable, comment out `packed_simd` in the Cargo.toml, and you should be able to build any of the examples except julia-simd and julia-both.
